# 1fichier_debrid
Quick bash script to debrid 1fichier links and bypass time limit

This script depends on `cURL` and `html-xml-utils`. 
On Ubuntu, these dependencies can be installed by running the following command:
```$ sudo apt install curl html-xml-utils```

On MacOS:
```$ brew install install curl html-xml-utils```

Then add all your links in `links.txt` with a line return between each link:
```link1
link2
link3```

Finally you can easily run the script by typing:
```./debrid.sh```
